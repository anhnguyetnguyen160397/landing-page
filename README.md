# landing-page
This is a project from my Udacity course. The project is to create a landing page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to transform a static website to an interactive one.
The page is built with 3 sections and the navigation menu with the funcitonality to scroll to the target section. I've also used the Javascript to highlight the section in view in the navigation bar and also in the corresponding section.
